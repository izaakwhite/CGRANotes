How to debug in Kratos
######################

Debug hardware as software
==========================
One major feature of Kratos is to allow designers debug their hardware
designers in a fashion close to debugging software. Kratos has a suite of tools
to support a wide-range of SystemVerilog simulators such as Verilator and
ncsim.

Here is a demonstration of debugging a design written in Kratos:

Which line generates this SystemVerilog?
========================================
kratos comes with a GUI to help you debug the system verilog it
generated. You need to install ``kratos-debug`` to use the tool:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install kratos-debug

Once installed, you can do

.. code-block:: bash

    kratos-debug [src.sv]

It will launch a window as the one below:

The left panel shows the generated verilog. You can click on any
line that's highlighted and the right panel will show you the source
code that's responsible for that particular line.

.. note::
    To use this feature, you have to set `debug=True` when initializing
    the ``Generator.__init__()``. In addition, you also need to
    use ``verilog(mod, debug=True, filename=[src.sv])`` when generating
    the verilog, where ``mod`` is the top generator, and ``[src.sv]``
    is the target system source file. The function will also produce
    ``[src.sv.].debug`` in the same directory as ``[src.sv]``. You
    need that file for ``kratos-debug``.

    You can slo turn the debug mode on on a global scale. You can think
    global debug as ``-g`` in C/C++ compilers.

    To do so, simply do

    .. code-block:: Python

        kratos.generator.set_global_debug(True)


Commenting SystemVerilog
========================

Kratos provides a way to let users comment on on high-level constructs
that will be turned into SystemVerilog comments. In most cases, you can
call ``kratos.comment(node, comment_str)`` to comment any IR node.

In some helper functions where obtaining the node is impossible, these
helper functions typically have optional arguments called ``comemnt_str``
that can help you to comment things.

.. note::

    Notice that not all the node being commented will appear in
    SystemVerilog right now. We are actively working on refactoring codebase
    to completely support this feature.
