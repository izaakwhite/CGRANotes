This folder contains scripts that generate random netlists as well as hardware for testing.

### Usage:
All the command line options have descriptions:
```
$python generate_hardware.py -h
$python generate_netlist.py -h
```

Based on current development, it might break the PnR flow. Please file an issue if it does.
